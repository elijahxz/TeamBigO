# TeamBigO



## HackMT 2024 Project

For this project, we calculate the exact Time Complexity of a function as a Python script.
Both the Big O function and the growth rate function are calculated.

## How to run: 
1. Install Python Dependencies
    * tkinter (pip install tk)
    * sympy (pip install sympy)
    * matplotllib (pip install matplotlib)
    * pillow (pip install pillow)
2. Clone the repository
3. Run the gui.py file (python gui.py)
4. Click "Select Text File"
    * Choose a file inside of the testCases directory
5. Click "Calculate"
6. Click "Graph Big O"
7. Open the file selected in step 4, to verify accuracy.

8. Special notes:
    * The only cases accounted for are very simple loops.
    * Please refer to the testCases directory to see what can be computed.

## Post-Event Details:
  We placed second out of ten teams. Our team was able to calculate the time complexity for functions with constants and simple loops. The algorithm also detects if the input variable for a function is manipulated to change the growth rate. ie: x = x[:k] means that the loop would be determined by k instead of x. Some of the team plans on continuing the project, and we all had a lot of fun!
