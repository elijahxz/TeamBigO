# TeamBigO
HackMT 2024 Project

For this project, we are going to calculate the exact Time Complexity of a function as a Python script.
We will calculate both the Big O function and the growth rate function.

Libraries used: tkinter, ast, sympy, matplotlib, pillow

Post-Event Details:
  We placed second out of ten teams. Our team was able to calculate the time complexity for functions with constants and simple loops. The algorithm also detects if the input variable for a function is manipulated to change the growth rate. ie: x = x[:k] means that the loop would be determined by k instead of x. Some of the team plans on continuing the project, and we all had a lot of fun!
